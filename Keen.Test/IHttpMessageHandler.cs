    /// where we want to alter some behavior, but let the rest execute normally. If the test just
    /// tests/mutates and forwards to another handler, it can implement this interface and be used
    /// in place of either type of handler in tests.
    /// 
    /// It's a bad idea to reuse instances of this type, since the wrappers as well as the
    /// HttpClient and pipeline code mess with their properties. Weirdness ensues, so create a
    /// fresh instance every time at the point where you create the wrapper or stick it in the
    /// pipeline, and don't store a reference to it unless it's needed to check later in an
    /// assert or some verification logic, but generally don't reuse it.
